# Protohost Global Configuration Example
# Copy this file to ~/.protohost/config to set machine-wide defaults
# These settings apply to all projects but can be overridden per-project

# SSH Configuration
# Specify a custom SSH key to use for all remote connections
# This is useful if you use a non-standard key or have multiple keys
SSH_KEY_PATH="~/.ssh/id_rsa"

# You can also set other defaults here that apply across all projects
# For example, if you always use the same remote user:
# REMOTE_USER="your-username"

# Or if you have a standard deployment directory:
# REMOTE_BASE_DIR="~/protohost"

# Note: Per-project settings in .protohost.config will override these global settings
